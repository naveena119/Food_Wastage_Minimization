# Food_Wastage_Minimization

Food waste is considered as a global problem because of the number of people who are suffering from starvation. Nearly 40% of food produced in India is wasted every year
due to fragment food system and inefficient supply chains. In order to overcome this problem here's a food wastage management app hunger.

Hunger is a real-time app which aims to reduce food wastage. Any person can register themselves as a user and can either donate or receive food.

If a person is a new user he needs to register by clicking on sign up and then by providing email credentials and password. If a person is an existing user he needs to enter
email credentials, password and click on sign in.
Then user gets two options either donate or receive food. On selecting donate button user needs to fill in the details of the food item and click on donate. 
An acknowledgment donated is displayed. The details along with location are stored in a firebase in the backend.
On selecting receive button list of donated food items are displayed, user can select a desired item and view its location.User can reach the particular location and 
receive the food. 

As hotels or restaurants are major sources of leftover foods, they can enter the food details in hunger app and donate it.
The orphanages or any person can receive the food. In this way the leftover food is donated instead of being wasted.
